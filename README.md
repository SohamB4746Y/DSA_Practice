# DSA Patterns Practice

Simple beginner-level collection of Data Structures & Algorithms problems organized by common problem-solving patterns you are practicing.

## Purpose
Practice and learn core DSA patterns with short, focused problems and clean solutions.

## Patterns (beginner)
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hashing / Hash Map
- Binary Search
- DFS / BFS (basic)
- Simple Dynamic Programming (intro)

## How to use
1. Pick a pattern folder (e.g., `patterns/sliding-window/`).
2. Open a problem, read the README, try to solve it yourself.
3. Compare with the provided solution and note the time/space complexity.

## Contributing / Adding solutions
- Add a new folder under the relevant pattern.
- Include: `README.md` (problem + approach) and `solution.{py,cpp,js,...}`.
- Keep solutions short, commented, and include complexity.
